# Privacy Policy

Last Updated: April 08, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how Blocked in Time ("the Game," "we," or "us") handles your information when you use our puzzle game. We are committed to protecting your privacy. Please read this policy carefully.

## Information We Collect

### Information You Provide
We do not collect any personal information directly from you. The Game does not require you to create an account, log in, or provide details such as your name, email address, or other personal data.

### Information Collected Automatically
The Game itself does not collect any data about you. However, we use Google AdMob to display advertisements within the Game. When you watch ads to earn in-game currency, AdMob may collect certain information automatically, such as:
- Device information (e.g., device type, operating system)
- IP address
- Advertising ID (a unique identifier for ad purposes)
- Usage data (e.g., interactions with ads)

This data is collected by AdMob, not by us, and is used to serve relevant ads and improve ad performance. We do not have direct access to this data.

## How We Use Information
Since we do not collect personal information ourselves, we do not use it for any purpose. The in-game currency you earn by watching ads stays within the Game and has no real-world value.

AdMob uses the data it collects to:
- Provide, personalize, and measure advertisements
- Analyze ad performance

For more details on how AdMob handles data, please refer to [Google’s Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

## Sharing Your Information
We do not collect or share any personal information with third parties. Any data collected by AdMob is managed by Google under its own policies and may be shared with its partners for ad-related purposes. We do not control or have access to this data.

## Children’s Privacy
The Game is suitable for players of all ages, including children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone, including children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided personal information through the Game, please contact us at support@rcamcreative.com, and we will work to address the issue. Note that AdMob may collect data as described above, and we encourage you to review Google’s policies for more information.

## Third-Party Services
The Game uses Google AdMob for advertisements. AdMob is a third-party service provided by Google, and its data practices are governed by [Google’s Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy). We do not use any other third-party services that collect data.

## Your Choices
You can play the Game without watching ads if you prefer not to engage with AdMob’s data collection. However, watching ads is optional and allows you to earn additional in-game currency. To manage ad personalization, you can adjust your device’s advertising settings (e.g., opt out of personalized ads via your device’s ad ID settings).

## Security
Since we do not collect personal data, we have no personal information to secure. The Game operates as a closed environment, and in-game currency is managed locally on your device.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will update the “Last Updated” date at the top of this page. Please check back periodically for any updates.

## Contact Us
If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at support@rcamcreative.com.

Thank you for playing Blocked in Time!
